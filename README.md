Hi everyone! I'm Angela (I go by Angel). I'm a stay-at-home-mom with 3 kids all in school now. In my spare time, I love photography as well as reading pretty much anything I can get my hands on. I'm intersted in front-end work, especially designing new web pages! My house is also a zoo with eleven animals.
